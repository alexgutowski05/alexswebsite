					This web design class was probally one of the only classes I've taken where I still use the skills I learned. In fact, 
          I'm using them right now to tell you about this! This class taught me the basics of HTML and CSS coding, as well as 
          showed me how to use Adobe Dreamweaver. I've picked up more skills on my own since then, with the help of sites like 
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>, but the majority of what I know was learned in this class.

					I made two final projects for each trimester of web design I took. <a href="https://dearevanhansenfilm.netlify.app">Trimester one</a> 
          was entirely HTML and CSS, while <a href="https://pcpartchooser.netlify.app">trimester two</a> was where we learned and used Dreamweaver.
