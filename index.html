				<p>
					My name is Alex Gutowski. I am a Junior at 
          				<a href="https://www.salineschools.org/schools/saline-high-school">Saline High School</a>,
         				and I have taken many multimedia classes in my education so far. Starting off, at the 
          				very beginning in 7th and 8th grade, I took Multimedia at 
          				<a href="https://www.salineschools.org/schools/saline-middle-school">Saline Middle School</a> 
          				taught by <a href="mailto:reevesd@salineschools.org">Mr. David Reeves</a>. This class 
          				is what revealed my passion for photography and videography. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I proceeded, in freshman year, to take <a href="video1.html">Video Production 1</a> instructed by 
					<a href="mailto:bushn@salineschools.org">Mr. Nathan Bush</a> where I made several small videos 
					to get used to professional camcorders and Adobe Premiere Pro. In class, we use Panasonic UX-90 cameras, 
					and I have gotten to know them pretty well, as well as their UX-180 counterparts. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In freshman year, I also took a class in <a href="webdesign.html">web design</a>, instructed by 
					Mrs. Dawn Gillow, learning how to create websites with HTML and CSS. I also learned how to use 
					Adobe Dreamweaver. I enjoy coding, and this entire website you are reading this on now was made 
					with HTML and CSS.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the end of freshman year, I began a class in <a href="photography.html">darkroom photography</a>, instructed by 
					<a href="mailto=rodriada@salineschools.org">Mr. Adam Rodriguez</a>, however, COVID hit and the class 
					became digital photography. I enjoyed that class, and learned a lot, despite it being taught through a virtual setting. 
					I used my own personal Canon Rebel T1i for that class and I used my dad's Canon EOS 80D a little as well.
				</p>				   
				<p>
					After I completed Video Production 1, I was lucky enough to be invited to <a href="videonews.html">Video News Production</a>, 
					a class usually reserved for Juniors and Seniors, as a Sophomore. I learned so much about creating pre-produced media, creating 
					live productions, and working in a team to create a final project. I am super proud to say that I was part of a team that 
					managed to win a Gold award from the Michigan Interscholastic Press Association (MIPA) and won a Student Excellence Award from 
					the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS). I also managed to win 3rd place from MIPA in Localized News Analysis 
					for my story on Autonomous Cars. At the end of the year, we had 18 shows to show off, and we took the Adobe Certified Associate 
					Exam where I became professionally certified in Digital Video Using Adobe Premiere Pro (for certification status, please contact 
					me).
				</p>
				<p>
					Still in sophomore year, I took <a href="compsci.html">Computer Science 1</a>, instructed by 
					<a href="mailto:fosterbl@salineschools.org">Mr. Blake Foster</a>. I learned a lot about Java code and made a handful 
					of programs that help me to this very day. I enjoy coding, and I do a lot with it in my free time.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the third trimester of my sophomore year, I was in <a href="video2.html">Video Production 2</a>. I had a lot of fun 
					in that class and learned a lot more about videography. Our final project was a mini-documentary about a candy store 
					in our town, and I plan to submit that to MIPA later this year to hopefully win an award. I am very proud of what my group 
					and I were able to accomplish in that documentary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now as you may recall, above I mentioned earlier that I had darkroom photography originally in freshman year, but it wasn't 
					possible due to COVID. I was able to <a href="darkroomphotography.html">take that class</a> again in my junior year, and I had 
					a lot of fun. I learned a lot about film cameras, how to develop images, how to use an enlarger, and many manual photo techniques 
					that will help assist me in making my photos better. I used a Canon FTb camera for that class, and I had a lot of fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					And that brings me to now. I'm currently enrolled in second-year Video News Production and I am one of two producers for SHS 
					Today for the 2021-2022 school year. I made an <a href="videonews.html#swwcvideo">advertisement in that class for another class</a>, 
					I helped make a <a href="videonews.html#fightsong">video to amp up our school's spirit</a>, and I have successfully produced one 
					show (as of December 17, 2021), producing more throughout the year. I'm also in AP Computer Science, learning more and more about 
					the Java coding language, and creating programs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy these things because they give me creativity.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy these things because they give me a place to escape.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy these things because they make me, me.
