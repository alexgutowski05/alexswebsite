				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					My name is Alex Gutowski. I am a Junior at 
          				<a href="https://www.salineschools.org/schools/saline-high-school">Saline High School</a>,
         				and I have taken many multimedia classes in my education so far. Starting off, at the 
          				very beginning in 7th and 8th grade, I took Multimedia at 
          				<a href="https://www.salineschools.org/schools/saline-middle-school">Saline Middle School</a> 
          				taught by <a href="mailto:reevesd@salineschools.org">Mr. David Reeves</a>. This class 
          				is what revealed my passion for photography and videography. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I proceded, in freshman year, to take Video Production 1 instructed by 
					<a href="mailto:bushn@salineschools.org">Mr. Nathan Bush</a> where I made a number of small videos 
					to get used to professional camcorders and Adobe Premiere Pro. In class we use Panasonic UX-90 cameras, 
					and I have gotten to know them pretty well, as well as their UX-180 counterparts. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In freshman year, I also took a class in web design, instructed by 
					<a href="mailto:gillowd@salineschools.org">Mrs. Dawn Gillow</a>, learning how to create websites with HTML 
					and CSS. I also learned how to use Adobe Dreamweaver. I enjoy coding, and this entire website you are reading 
					this on now was made with HTML and CSS.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the end of freshman year, I began a class in darkroom photography, instructed by 
					<a href="mailto=rodriada@salineschools.org">Mr. Adam Rodriguez</a>, however COVID hit and the class basically 
					became digital photography. I enjoyed that class, and learned a lot, despite it being taught through a virtual setting. 
					I used my own personal Canon Rebel T1i for that class and I used my dad's Canon EOS 80D a little as well.
				</p>				   
				<p>
					After I completed Video Production 1, I was lucky enough to be invited to Video News Production, a class usually 
					reserved for Juniors and Seniors, as a Sophomore. I learned so much about creating pre-produced media, 
					creating live productions, and working in a team to create a final project. I am super proud to say that 
					I was part of a team that managed to win a Gold award from the Michigan Interscholastic Press Association 
					(MIPA) and won a Student Excellence Award from the National Acadamy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS).
					I myself also managed to win 3rd place from MIPA in Localized News Analysis for my story on Autonomous Cars.
					At the end of the year we had 18 shows to show off, and we took the Adobe Certifified Assosiate Exam where I 
					became professionally certified in Digital Video Using Adobe Premiere Pro (for certification status, please 
					contact me).
				</p>
				<p>
					Still in sophomore year, I took Computer Science 1, instructed by 
					<a href="mailto:fosterbl@salineschools.org">Mr. Blake Foster</a>. I learned a lot about Java code and made a handful 
					of programs that help me to this very day. I really enjoy coding, and I do a lot with it in my free time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Third trimester of my sophomore year, I was in Video Production 2. I had a lot of fun in that class, and learned a lot 
					more about videography. Our final project was a mini-documentary about a candy store in our town, and I plan to submit 
					that to MIPA later this year to hopefully win an award. I am very proud of what my group and I were able to accomplish 
					in that documentary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now as you may recall, above I mentioned earlier that I had darkroom photography originally in freshman year, but it wasn't 
					really possible due to COVID. I was able to take that class again in my junior year, and I had a lot of fun. I learned a lot 
					about film cameras, how to develop images, how to use an enlarger, and many manual photo techniques that will help assist me 
					in making my photos better. I used a Canon FTb camera for that class, and I had a lot of fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					And that brings me to now. I'm currently enrolled in second year Video News Production and I am one of two producers for SHS 
					Today for the 2021-2022 school year. I made an advertisement in that class for another class, I helped make a video to amp up 
					our school's spirit, and I have sucessfully produced one show (as of December 17, 2021), producing more throughout the year. 
					I'm also in AP Computer Science, learning more and more about the Java coding language, and creating programs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy these things because they give me creativity.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy these things because they give me a place to escape.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy these things because they make me, me.
				</p>
