				<h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>

				<p>
					Hello! My name is Alex Gutowski. I’m a current Sophomore at Michigan 
					State University majoring in Digital Storytelling. I’m currently the 
					Tech Director of <a href=https://www.msutelecasters.com/>MSU Telecasters</a>, 
					working with all the shows in our network to manage their technology 
					requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before I went to Michigan State, I was enrolled at Saline High School. 
					There I took many digital arts classes and produced countless pieces of work. 
					I was a producer for SHS Today, one of two student news shows our school 
					produces, as well as a technical director for the Saline Live Video Crew, a 
					team of people who livestream sports, shows in the theater, and other events 
					around the district. Both positions were the highest positions offered to a 
					student in their respective field. Outside of broadcast, I also took numerous 
					photography and graphic design classes and I enjoy taking photos in my 
					everyday life.
				</p>
