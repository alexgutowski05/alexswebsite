                    Hello! My name is Alex Gutowski. I'm a current Senior at Saline High School in Saline, 
                    MI and I'm committed to Michigan State University for the 2023 Fall Semester. I've 
                    taken many digital arts classes and produced countless pieces of work. I'm a producer 
                    for SHS Today, one of the two student news shows, as well as a technical director for the 
                    Saline Live Video Crew, a team of people who livestream sports, shows in the theater, 
                    and other events around the district. Both of those positions are the highest position 
                    offered to a student in their respective field. Outside of broadcast, I've also taken 
                    numerous photography and graphic design classes and I enjoy taking photos in my everyday 
                    life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the world of digital media, I'm a member of Hornet Light and Sound, an 
                    extracurricular club that runs tech in our district's theater spaces. Our drama club puts 
                    on two shows every year in our theater that we run tech for, along with district music 
                    concerts, board meetings, and we provide tech to people who rent out the space, who utilize 
                    it for plays, musicals, dance recitals, and awards ceremonies. In this club, I serve the 
                    role of Junior Supervisor which, like the programs listed above, is also the highest role 
                    offered to a student.
                </p>
